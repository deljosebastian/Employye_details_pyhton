# Employee Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project analyzes employee data of a company based on a CSV dataset, providing insights into team distributions, role segregation, age demographics, salary expenditures, and potential correlations between age and salary. The analysis addresses specific client queries using Python and data visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset, `Dataset.csv`, includes information on each employee, covering aspects like team, position, age, and salary. 

## Objectives
The project aims to answer the following client queries:

1. **Employee Distribution by Team**: Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
2. **Position-based Segregation**: Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.
3. **Predominant Age Group**: Identify the predominant age group among employees.
4. **Highest Salary Expenditure**: Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
5. **Age-Salary Correlation**: Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.

## Project Files
- `Main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.
- `Dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the employee dataset.
- `query_answers.txt`: File with concise answers to each of the clientâ€™s queries.

## Key Insights
1. **Team Distribution**: The Notebook provides a breakdown of employee numbers across teams, along with each team's percentage of the total workforce.
2. **Position Segregation**: Employees are classified by their respective roles, enabling insights into role distribution.
3. **Age Group Analysis**: The most common age range is identified to understand the predominant age demographic.
4. **Salary Expenditure by Team and Position**: Analysis reveals which team and position hold the highest salary costs.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: A scatter plot with trend lines visualizes any correlation between age and salary.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
